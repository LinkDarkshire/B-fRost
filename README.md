# B-fRost

The small program here was at the beginning only meant to convert BeatSaber maps into Ragnarock maps (which currently works more or less). That's why it's called B-fRost (Beatsabermaps for Ragnarock ... no idea what the rest should stand for but it sounded better that way ^^) Since I haven't found any software to easily convert from other formats to Ragnarock maps, I'm extending this with said functions.

ToDo:
- Midi to Ragnarock
